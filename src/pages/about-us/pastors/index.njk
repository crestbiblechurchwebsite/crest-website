    <p class="italic">Senior Pastor</p>
    <p>
      Greg is a hometown product, raised right here in Kansas City, Kansas. At the age of 25, he realized that he was a sinner in need of a Saviour, and trusted Jesus Christ to save him from his sin. Very shortly after that, he moved to Cincinnati, Ohio and joined the Landmark Baptist Temple (Pastor John Rawlings) where he got his basic training in the word of God. In 1983, he moved back home and joined the Kansas City Baptist Temple, where he received further training for the ministry.

    <p class="italic">Associate Pastor</p>
    <p>
      Ross was raised in Kansas City, Kansas and attended Wyandotte High School. Ross accepted Christ as his Saviour at the age of 15 at a Youth For Christ rally in Kansas City, Kansas. As a boy, Ross attended the Calvary Baptist Church (Pastor Fred Spendor), at 10th & Grandview Blvd., in Kansas City, Kansas. It is at this church that Ross received a strong Christian foundation that would last the rest of his life. It was at this church where Ross (age 12) first felt that God might be calling him into ministry, as he dreamed of being a pastor someday.
