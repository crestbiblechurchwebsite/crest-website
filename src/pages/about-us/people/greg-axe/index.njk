    <p>
      Greg is a hometown product, raised right here in Kansas City, Kansas. At the age of 25, he realized that he was a sinner in need of a Saviour, and trusted Jesus Christ to save him from his sin. Very shortly after that, he moved to Cincinnati, Ohio and joined the Landmark Baptist Temple (Pastor John Rawlings) where he got his basic training in the word of God. In 1983, he moved back home and joined the Kansas City Baptist Temple, where he received further training for the ministry. He graduated in the first class of the Shepherd's School of Ministry in 1988, and joined the pastoral staff of KCBT in 1991. In January of 1994, Greg was called as the Senior Pastor of a sister church, Crest Bible Church of Kansas City, Kansas. Greg is the co-author of the Discipleship Ministry of the Kansas City Baptist Temple, which has been exported to hundreds of churches in the United States, and translated into over 20 languages in use on every continent except Antarctica (penguins don't get saved). He has also authored several Bible study books and tools, and currently teaches in the Living Faith Bible Institute.
